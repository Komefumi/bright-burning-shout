## Hold Up

Want to know where I got the name from? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIZ-4jUJLk8)

This is (yet another) project template. It was supposed to utilize Golang, but I've decided to go with node instead for any purpose I would have satisfied with Go.

The reason being that I couldn't get a clean enough solution for file watching with fsnotify.

Go isn't where I have the most hands on experience in. So a future release may feature Go to increase performance. But for now, go with this node powered project.

Note: To access the web pages generated, you need to go to `localhost:3333/pages` and not simply the root url.

Changes made to files imported by the `module-entries` won't trigger a re-compilation of the module-entries. Make a dummy change in the module-entry to have a recompilation happen.

More detail will be added in future.
